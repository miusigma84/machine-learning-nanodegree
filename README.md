## Machine-Learning-Nanodegree:
Udacity's Machine Learning Nanodegree project files and notes.

This repository contains project files and lecture notes for Udacity's Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree program which I started working on in July 2017.

The Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree is an online certification. It involves Courses in Supervised learning, Unsupervised learning, Reinforcement learning and Deep Learning.

Courses include lecture videos, quizzes, programming problems. These courses were developed by Georgia Tech, Udacity, Google and Kaggle.

This directory includes my submission of the mandatory project work for each module in the form of the IPython notebook and a final Capstone project on stock price prediction using machine learning.

## Program Outline:

* ### Exploratory Project
### Project 0: Titanic Survival Exploration
Exploring Titanic Dataset and understand the basics.

* ### Model Evaluation and Validation
### Project 1: Predicting Boston Housing Prices
Explored the basics of machine learning by predicting housing prices on the Boston Housing Dataset. This project introduced the concepts of training and testing sets, basic decision trees, and regression algorithms.

* ### Supervised Learning
### Project 2: Finding Donors
Determined the best segment of people to solicit for donations based on several features from a dataset. Learned about naive predictors, metrics for determining model performance, and several supervised learning algorithms. Decision trees, KNN, SVC, logistic regression, and Gaussian naive Bayes were all compared using cross validation techniques.

* ### Unsupervised Learning
### Project 3: Creating Customer Segments
Using a dataset of sales figures, customers were categorized into segments based on their purchases. The number of segments was determined by cross-validation. Outliers were found and removed from the dataset. Gaussian Mixture and PCA were used to find the best separation between clusters.

* ### Reinforcement Learning
### Project 4: Train a Smartcab to Drive (Implement Q-learning algorithm)
Reinforcement learning was used to train a cab to make the correct decisions while navigating busy intersections.

* ### Deep Learning
### Project 5: Dog Project
Convolutional Neural Networks and Transfer learning were used to detect faces in images and then predict breeds from new pictures. The same algorithm was then adapted to predict which dog breeds humans looked like.

* ### Capstone Project
Using concepts learned during the course of the nanodegree to predict the movement of stock prices and implement a trading strategy based on it.
